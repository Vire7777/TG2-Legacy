I rewrote this so that if you spent enough money on your feast everyone will come (who could refuse great food and great music?). This will be your non-violent way to successfully end feuds and will greatly improve your chances of getting the office position you want!

IMPORTANT: Game Mechanics Changed In Order To Fix CTD Issue! Please read 
Here Is A LINK To A Comment Made By FH Who Is The Main Programmer/Scripter for The Guild 2 - Renaissance about the Game Mechanic Changes We Made
- Can no longer Attack Buildings due to CTD mesh bug linked with Orchard & Farm Buildings.
- Capture building has been modified. A building must have been recently sabotaged in order to capture. If guards are too close you cannot capture building (error message will pop up)
- Since you can no longer attack buildings the damage caused by sabotaging a building has been greatly increased 
- Changed the AI script from attacking buildings to sabotage them instead
- Fixed Multiple Script Errors found in posted logfiles
- Assassinate and Burn Witch AI scripts have been rewritten and players should be less likely to die
- New measure added to keep track of faith percentage of main characters (75% and above keeps you safe from burning)
- Fixed outlaw bug...again  (hopefully third times a charm )
- Changed outlaw sentence in KingPunish and EmperorPunish to time in the Pillory   (This fixes a bug)
- Fixed buy nobility title error (can now click on townhall without your character being in building and purchase a nobility title) <---this worked in vanilla, it was remnants of Fajeth mod pack I accidentally added, forgot to test and never removed  


Fixes Provided In Hotfix Version 1

- Fixed Script Error causing Oos in Blackdeath.lua
- invite to dance, take a bath and items.dbt files all back to vanilla (no bugs)
- Outlaw Fixes for missing a trial, imperial punish, royal punish and consequence for killing judge <--- Apparently outlaw bug was NEVER fixed in Vanilla. Entries in trial.lua had to be added as well as Action.dbt needed to be tweaked. This is sad because I had it fixed in a mod before PotES even existed let alone Venice or Renaissance 
- Can now capture buildings that do not have owners


Current Version 1.02

- Added REB Mod created by Kinver  <---fixed numerous bugs and removed certain files incompatible with Legacy mod

Fixes Provided in Version 1.01

- AI now uses all new measures introduced in Legacy mod pack

- Fixed many issues in Repopulate measure
- Added Worker list from Fajeth mod pack (sorted by level & age) 
- Removed List measure and moved Pope candidate list into proper place


Description:

* Repopulate - AI Helper
- On/Off button. This is the most important file in the game and should be Initiated By first clicking on townhall and then the Repopulate button on townhall at the start of the game. 
- Financial Assistance. AI only get a certain amount of money based on number of family members. Spam cheat not possible. (turns off if you press cancel repopulate button) 
- AI Random titles. Mathematically set up to resemble real-life. Most should have lower titles, however it is theoretically possible to have it reversed. Very unlikely though. Lump sum of Money is given to reflect the title
- AI Auto-upgrade their equipment in this file over time (This shuts off when file is turned off)
- Gives AI a child if they have a low amount of family members (Can be turned off)
- This file also trigger countless AI Actions so they use measures and abilities.  (Once turned on it cannot be shut-off. The checks continue automatically)
    --AutoAI uses (King Measures, Pope Measures, Emperor Measures, Poison Well, Cardinal Favor)
- Burn Witch <---AI use this but it can now be turned off when you press the cancel AI Helper button 
- Assassinate <---AI use this but it can now be turned off when you press the cancel AI Helper button

* REB - Economy Mod
- Balanced Economy
- Bank Profession fixes
- Kinver's REB Mod Thread: LINK
[Idea By: kinver Created By: kinver Bugfixes By: McCoy!]

* Bribe The Guards
- Slip some coins to the right office member and the guards may ignore your foul deeds for a little while. This version has been tweaked. Bribe success depends on the officeholders disposition (the one who controls the town guards). Make sure to check out his disposition before bribing. If his disposition is high then bribing a higher amount is highly recommended as there is now a consequence for refusal 
[Idea By: McCoy!, Created By: McCoy!]

* Trial Fixes 
- Message fixes 
- also turns off trial cutscene (hopefully this helps stabilize mp games) <---also adds to difficulty because you no longer know what the judge or assessors are thinking
[Idea By: chip007 Created By: chip007]

* Give Money
- Go to a bank you to give a % of your money to another sim. Especially useful in MP games with noobs 
[Idea By: Kaliandr Created By: McCoy!]

* Raise Disposition 
- Sick of being a walking nightmare? Now you can literally bribe the entire city to improve your disposition. People simply refuse to believe the rumors of your atrocities...after all a person who gives a complete stranger money for no reason can't be all that bad. Simply go to a bank and you will have the option to give your townsfolk some money
[Idea By: McCoy! Created By: InsaneKaos & McCoy!]

* Hire an Assassin
- Want someone dead without the need to get your hands dirty ? Go to a tavern or hedge tavern between midnight and 02:00am and hire yourself an assassin. Remember that the more distinguished the target the more it will cost (takes into account title and office)
- Targets with low disposition are 10% of the normal cost.
- Tavern Owner gets 10% cut of what you pay...if you own the tavern think of it as a 10% discount
[Idea By: McCoy! Created By: McCoy!]

* Quick Political Bribe 
- Is the office member you want to bribe busy or in a distant town right now? Simply go to a bank and you will have the option to deposit some money into their account (system works exactly the same as if you bribed them normally)
[Idea By: McCoy! Created By: McCoy! & InsaneKaos]

* Call The Guards I & II
- Was an old or useless dynasty member kidnapped and now some thief is demanding a ransom? Now you have the option to call the guards and watch the thief lose his head. This will result in your dynasty members death as well but used in the right circumstances who cares!?!
- Are you sick and tired of Robbers always trying to extort protection money? Now when they do this you have the option to call the guards...this will result in the robber trying to sabotage your home. If you have henchmen nearby they will try to stop him or if the guards are nearby they will stop him. However even if he succeeds the cost to renovate your home will still be less then paying for their protection. Also when the guards catch the robber you will get to see him do some time in the pillory
[Idea By: Jeriah Created By: McCoy!]

* Accuse men of Heresy or women of witchcraft 
- Another way to kill without getting your hands dirty. Pay the church enough money and you can accuse a man or woman of witchcraft and see her burn. You cannot accuse Fanatics. You cannot accuse anyone who is currently in a different town (it would take too long for the sequence of events to complete). Simply go into a church and you will see the new Burn A Witch button  
- Targets with sufficiently low faith are 10% of the cost. You get dinged if you want to falsely accuse someone. However if your target's faith is too high accusation is not possibe. Church owner gets 10% of the cost
[Idea By: Aragornil Created By: McCoy!]

* Increase severity of justice 
- Justice is even more harsh when Judge sets it to Severe. There is a downside...your empathy skills will be permanently affected. -3 for setting it to severe +1 if you set it to lenient. 
NOTE: The empathy skills only affect the judge who changed the severity
[Idea By: Aragornil Created By: McCoy!]

* Option for longer banishment time 
- When banishing someone you now have to option to pay money in order to make their banishment time longer. The more distinguished the target is the more the added banishment time will cost. You still have the default banishment option that costs no money
[Idea By: Aragornil Created By: McCoy!]

* Prevent cheat that allows player to capture and sell same building continuously. 
- Bug: Capture building then sell it only to recapture it again. Repeating this process numerous times results in quite a bit of cash depending on the building and whats in the inventory. 
- Feature: Now you cannot sell a captured building for a certain amount of time (works like a recently burgled building)
[Idea By: McCoy! Created By: McCoy!]

* Harsh consequences for Attacking/killing Judge involved in a trial or an Accuser
- Avoiding an outlaw sentence used to be easy if you killed the accuser or judge. This is pretty much prevented with this mod. Attacking either will draw the guards and if you successfully kill either one then there will be serious consequences...(spy theme has been incorporated into the text to make these consequences flow with the game)
[Idea By: McCoy! Created By: McCoy!]

* More Challenging Bribing System
- Default 2.2 bribing system is based on a targets wealth + office. 
- More Challenging Bribing System adds and extra cost onto a dynasties title (makes it so players try other items found at the marketplace to help out their cause)
[Idea By: Determinado Created By: McCoy!]

* The New Sections Added To Important Persons Tab (Workers sorted by level & age and Pope Candidates) 
- If there are no PopeCandidates no list will show up - To get yourself on that list you must go inside a church with your character and click on a council of cardinals button and donate money
- Unemployed Workers list sorted by Age & Level
[Idea By: thezirk & Nommy Created By: Nommy & McCoy!] 

* New Emperor & Pope Political Offices
- These new offices are only available in an Imperial/Capital City
- Two new offices added to the game...You cannot apply for the emperor office. The emperor is selected by money + wealth. You can also become the emperor by killing the emperor.
- King is auto selected but the sovereign can apply for the office. AI will apply too. Only the emperor votes the King into position
- If you are a Sovereign in another city you can quit remove yourself from office, assign this sim to residence in the imperial city and can apply for the office of King...
- If there are any candidates endorsed by the council of Cardinals the pope will be the one that has the highest level (5 levels of influence within the council). If more then one are the same level the winner is chosen randomly
- Council of cardinal button is visible when you enter a church. You have the option of donating money to the church to show your dedication to your faith. The contribution starts a $10,000 for the first level but escalates quickly to $1,000,000 for the 5th and final level
- Excommunication measure for pope. Target loses all faith (making them susceptible to burning) and All relations (Making them susceptible to assassinations) and all nobility titles, and 75% of their wealth just to add insult to injury 
- Papal Guard - Guard for the pope. They stay active a lot longer them the Royal Guard
- Pope can oust any religious office holder in ANY city...all favor is lost to that dynasty. This makes the player more susceptible to assassinations. 
- Emperor guard - Guard for the emperor. The guards stay active much longer then the papal guard
- Emperor can oust anyone in any city from office (Except church officials) with the consequence of losing favor...again player becomes more susceptible to assassinations
- Emperor Punish - Emperor can Tax, Execute, Outlaw, or imprison anyone one, once every 48hrs. The consequence is again low favor to dyanasty
- King Punish  Same as emperor punish EXCEPT that the target must have a somewhat low Disposition. (This is because the king is answerable to the Emperor) 
[Idea By: Napi96 & SunPack Created By: Sunpack & Napi96 Additional Content & Tweaks By: McCoy!]


* Misc 
- Diseases no longer claim last dynasty member (Exception is if two dynasty members get a fatal illness at the same time. However if you are already last sim then contract a fatal illness your sim will not die from it)
- BugFix: Diseases no longer affect certain professions (Inquistor, Executioner...ect) <---they get the disease but will NEVER die from it
- Money collected for extortion is based on building value
- Priests Gain Faith while preaching
- Become the Law mod has been balanced (If you abuse the office of Bailiff too much then at some point you will lose your office position and will have an active arrest warrant on you character)
- Political office voting system restructured
- Cannot apply for King unless you have held the position of Sovereign first.

Other Mods:
Gunsmith & Piracy v1.27 - The Guild 2: Renaissance
=================================================
I made the majority of this mod roughly a year ago but after having problems with the REB mod I gave up releasing it. 
In the past week or so, I've converted it to support the current McCoy fix pack with most of the other community fixes and also upgraded it a lot.

Gunsmith & Piracy now doesn't just return the Pirate haven to how it was in PoTES, it tries to re-imagine it as both a pirate bay and a gunpowder specialist for the rogue. 
Naturally it provides the rogue a better opportunity to arm him or herself with the latest in first-strike weaponry. Just what we needed! ::)

I've balanced this cross-class production so that it will be slightly more expensive to run, but suffers from less land-based competition. I don't think it will outperform a real smithy but provides the rogue with some 'semi-legal' opportunities to expand, as well as being able to actually improve trade economy rather than just destroy it.

Anyone is free to incorporate anything I have made, into their own mods should they wish to do so.

Installation
============
1. Install official patch 4.15
2. Install official patch 4.17b
3. Install McCoy's Legacy Mod 1.07
4. OPTIONAL - Install MappackEditionML 1.15 (Please note if you do not install the map pack, you will not be able to play the MapPack specific content, even if the menu shows these 3 maps.)

Extract Gunsmith & Piracy directly to your Renaissance directory after installing the above patches.
Allow it to overwrite any conflicting files.

If you wish to add additional mods I recommend using WinMerge or similar to resolve conflicts.

Main features
=============
The Pirates haven now has all three building levels, a new set of upgrades, and a gunsmith production chain.
The Hansa and Northsea maps have been hex-edited to have their pirate nests back for the AI!
Ships now have coloured flags and sails.
Carts can now supply other dynasties and not just your own dynasty via trade routes.
You can now use the free trade ability without upgrades to your house, regardless of your class.
Restores some of the older Guild 2 maps.

Rebalanced starting city randomizer.
Tweaks to remove the limitations of the storehouse.
A new level of mill and upgrades for it.

Gunsmithery
-----------
Pirate haven is now able to import/manufacture firearms and pistol munitions.

There are three new firearms in the game:
Early 1400s matchlock. 15 damage shot when entering combat. Unlocks for 600 gold with the level 1 Pirate's Haven.
Late 1400s wheellock. 30 damage shot when entering combat. Unlocks for 900 gold with the level 2 Pirate's Nest.
Early 1500s snaplock. 45 damage shot when entering combat. Unlocks for 1200 gold with a level 3 Pirate's Fortress.
The original matchlock can still be imported from the arsenal and deals 60 ranged damage + 15 melee.
All pistols require ammunition in your inventory. Ammunition is now also available from the marketplace.

Pirate haven
--------------
Pirate haven now costs 4000 for the first level but include a carrack vessel.
Pirate haven can now be upgraded to levels 2 and 3. Includes a new building upgrade scheme.

Thanks to McCoy, Fajeth, Darkliz and General Chaos for their efforts!

Known problems
==============
Higher level gunsmith workers will still be titled as serfs, the profession text seems hardcoded.
The Lyon 3s map has a defective field that AI cannot manage properly.
Ships may still circle the same spot endlessly as in vanilla, it is generally caused by high levels of time acceleration.
Scaffolding when building structures is still a mixed bag (not just for the pirate haven), I have not been able to correct these so far.
Pistol combat in general could use a re-work.
The second level of the Mill has a broken tooltip icon. I have yet to be able to find where this icon is located to edit it.
Orchard fields seem to have left over fencing from upgrading from the field.

Misc. Fixes, Tweaks & Mods

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY:

This collection of mods is compatible with McCoy's legacy modpack v. 1.02 with hotfix 1.08.  
It requires The Guild 2: Renaissance updated to v. 4.17b.
The text.dbt file has been edited to work with all of these mods and 4.17b and McCoy's legacy modpack.  However, if you add additional mods that impact the text.dbt file you will need to tweak the file included here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREDITS:

With the exception of the pregnancy, bath and go to sleep mods (originally created by Fajeth) and the ransom tweak and politics mod (created by General Chaos) all of these mods were created by DarkLiz.  A special thanks to her for help in figuring these out. Credit is due to LordProtektor, as I based some of the politics mod on his work. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:

1. Clothing items now convey the proper favor bonus when someone is within a certain radius of the wearer.
2. Toad slime now works as intended.
3. The market restocks certain items every hour. 
4. To account for increased wealth with McCoy's AI helper, ransom amounts for kidnapped persons is cut in half.
5. Pregnant women can now walk around and perform actions while pregnant.
6. Drinking in a public house or pub (by using the sit measure) with other dynasty members will convey a favor bonus.
7. Alchemy/magic system has been expanded.
8. Horse carriages can be used more easily and free of charge with the proper house level.
9. You are prompted with a dialogue option before firing an employee.
10. AI sims should apply for offices more frequently and at higher levels now.  This was done by making the timer for repeating an application attempt lower for them, removing the restriction that shadow dynasty families could only have one member in office and run only if no other shadows were running, and reducing the favor threshold for application decisions from less than 40 to less than 95.  This means that an AI dynasty will run pretty much no matter what.  The AI can now also apply for office at any time except between 18 and 1 hours.  This means they can apply first thing in a new round, when they may be more likely to have money.  The price to apply for office has also been reduced.
11. Dr. Faust's elixer will now actually cause a negative affect when the message is given.
12. Sleeping gives a bonus to constitution and craftsmanship (even if you sleep in the inn).
12. Taking a bath alone (at the inn) will cure some diseases and increase favor with other sims you pass.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

Copy the DB and Scripts folders in this package to the root directory of your Guild install and replace all files.
